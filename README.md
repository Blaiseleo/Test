# Test

This repo demonstrates How to use git, npm, express using cmd command lines to build a simple servers in javascript.

It also demonstrates how to commit changes to github and run projects using nodemon (short for node monitor). Used for 
restarting applications or projects automatically when there is a change in the script.

###  We will be using *** Visual Studio Code *** as our editor.

To get started, we would need to create a repository on github and link it to our project using this command;

             " git remote add origin LINK_TO_GITHUB_REPOSITORY "

# Next step, always remember to use the command "git init" on every project created, to keep track of changes made in project.

# Moving forward, we need to also run "npm init" which is used to create the necessary packages needed in the project.

# Next, we need to install npm, "npm install" (install npm the packages).

# Next step is to install Express (A javascript framework for creating databases). "npm i -g express".

i - install
-g - globally

Now we have nodemon installed, we no longer need to manually restart application after changes made. Nodemon handles it automatically.

Finally we can commit changed to our github repository using  " git push -u origin master "

git commit -m COMMENT - For adding commit messages (comments to the changes made)

git app FILENAME - you may need to add file name to project if there is an error in pushing project to github.

This project is still under construction. ;-)

Thanks for reading. 
Hope you learn something new.
